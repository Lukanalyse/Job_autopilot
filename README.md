Hi, first of all this is for a reseach project.

You do not have the database but the code in itself to understand what it does.

So, all the title are explicites about the files. The project is about generating CV and LM thanks to HTML templates.

After that we have the database links to the code that generate CM and LM. After we have the code that load part of the dataset (job offer to apply to).

We also have the link with ChatGPT to use it with his API and the prompt in the code to generate LM properly and with respect to the database.

One script is about sending the emails. So it is connected with the database and the CV + LM and Gmail STMP to connect and send an email with the documents.

If you do not understand something do not hesitate to contact me for further informations.
